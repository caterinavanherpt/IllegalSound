				<h3>Lusia Adamo</h3>
				<h3>50th Wedding Anniversary</h3>
				<h3>Toronto, Ontario</h3>
				<p>I would like to start off by thanking John and the whole Illegal Sound Entertainment Group for creating such a memorable event for us. We celebrated our parents 50th Wedding Anniversary and Illegal Sound was the hit at our festivities. From the moment we booked with them, all they were interested in was what we wanted. They took our thoughts and made them into reality. From hosting, playing, and giving our guest everything they wanted. There was not a soul that was not on their feet dancing the night away. They offered everything we wanted and more. I must say that without them at the core of our party we would not have had the turn out we did. You guys did a superb job and I am very pleased with all that you did. There are not enough thanks for all of you for helping our family celebrate 50 golden years. Thank-you, thank-you and thank-you. Can't wait for the next Illegal Sound Entertainment Party!</p>
